# PxStat
PxStat is a **Data Dissemination Management System** especially designed for National Statistical Institutes and Statistical Organisations, developed by the [CSO](https://www.cso.ie) (Central Statistics Office, Ireland) with the support of the **PC-Axis** Reference Group and the collaboration of the **Open Source** community.

The system is powered by a lightweight engine and provides a modern, responsive and efficient Web Interface and Web Services (API) for managing and disseminating statistics.

**End-Users** can run extensive meta-data searches , filter results, explore data by _"slicing and dicing"_, export results to different formats, visualise data over geographical layers, share their results and automate their processes by reading data via API queries. 
The outputs follow also the **Open Data** recommendations by providing access to multiple data formats (JSON-Stat, PX, XLSX, CSV) and is ready to enable RDF and LOD (Linked Open Data) to reach _"5 Star Linked Open Data"_.

PxStat also empowers the **Data-Owners** to manage the publication of their data through a Workflow to identify & prevent issues before going Live, track and schedule Releases to implement Embargo policies, compare data and meta-data across Releases over time and monitor the consumption of data via analytical tools.
